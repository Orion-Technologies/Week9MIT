Asynchronous programing code examples.

## ASYNC
In this example I am using resolvingAfter2Seconds() function, this function have a [promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise‚Äù), and setTimeout, the promise hopes a value (pending state), in this case the value is a string, the string is sending after 2 second, this time is setting by `<setTimeout()>` function.

## FETCH
`<fetch>` works if server allows [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS), this example gets for a font and shows it after fetch the addres.
[Await](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/await) is an operator used to wait a promise, the promise is implicit in the function.

## MAP_06_STARTER
Here I am using an api to follow a bus location in real time.

## PARALLEL
In this example all the functions start at the same time, but every one is showing according to the time setted.

## PROCEDURAL WITH TIMER
In this example the 3 functions returning its vowels, but the function `a()` has a timer, and after 3 secons shows a string.

## PROMISE
In this example I am using a `promise` object, I am showing the functions stored in `list[]` and after 3 seconds I am showing the vowels at the same time, is othet examplo of parallel process. 

## SERIES
This is a example of series process, the `<await>` makes this process.
